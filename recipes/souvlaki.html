    <ol class = "steps">
        <li><strong>Marinate:</strong> Add all the ingredients to a large sealable freezer bag or airtight container. Mix everything together well to coat each piece of chicken. Marinate for at least 2 hours, up to overnight.</li>
        <li><strong>Prep skewers:</strong> Meanwhile, soak the wooden skewers. Place them in a large baking dish or roasting pan and cover them with water by at least 1/2 inch. Soak for 1-2 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble:</strong> Preheat your grill over medium-high. Skewer the pieces of chicken, leaving about 1/2â€³ on the end of each skewer. I got 6 skewers.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook:</strong> Place the skewers on the grill and cook for about 3 minutes per side, or until completely cooked through. Transfer the skewers to a plate and let the chicken rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
